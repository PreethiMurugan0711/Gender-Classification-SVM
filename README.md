Gender Classification using SVM //
Project Overview
This project involves building a classification model to predict gender based on specific physical and demographic features. By using Support Vector Machines (SVM), I am exploring how high-dimensional boundaries can be used to separate classes effectively.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Preprocessing: StandardScaler for feature scaling and LabelEncoder for categorical data.

Algorithm: SVC (Support Vector Classifier).

📊 Key Steps Implemented
Data Cleaning: Handled categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the SVM distance calculations.

Modeling: Trained an SVM model to find the optimal hyperplane for classification.

Evaluation: Analyzed performance using a Confusion Matrix and Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
